# Random BGM
Unlike a DxD option, **this works also for dungeon**.
Also, this includes all of BGM (even if you don't have one).

This forces music ID just before loading, so this has **highest priority**.
This even will reroll ID and overwrite DoI random music.
**Max BGM index is 71**. BGM72 won't be played with this.
Of course, this BGM is played only in your side, so feel free to use this!

**Does not include future theme pass pack**.

- **Works on DxD**
- **Didn't test in Vanilla, may cause Crash**
- **Didn't test in Overhaul either**
