# Change Hero Colour to Pon Colour

- By default, hero body texture colour is always white.
- Recommended with custom Hero body texture (preferrably containing white).
   - Without custom texture, it changes only collar and Pyokorider saddle.
- Since this uses Pon colour, it doesn't work with Dark Heroes.

- Overhaul Compatible: `YES`
