# Getting started

## Required knowledge

- Knowledge about **hex**, data type and **binary calculation**. e.g. "bit", "byte", `and`, `or`, `xor`, "flag", "bitmask, ` etc.
- Basic programamtical arthimetic expression knowledge (Doesn't need to know C/C++).
  - Assembly/C++/C knowledge is not necessary, unless you go deep and *research* them.
- Learning by example (Sorry we don't have good teacher or resources)
- Patient enough to follow the flow, since the PAC instructions are bunch of "Goto" spaghetti.
- Search and Copypasta skill (like Programmers' good ol' friend Stackoverflow :D)
- **Being familiar with Patapon Param files**.
