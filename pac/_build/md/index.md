# Welcome!

Here are some basic guides about the PAC instructions.

- [What is PAC?](./guide/what-is-pac.md)
- [Code of Conduct](./guide/code-of-conduct.md)
- [Getting Started](./guide/getting-started.md)
- [Reading PAC](./guide/writing-pac.md)
- [Writing PAC](./guide/writing-pac.md)
- [Instructions by Category](./guide/category.md)
- [Reference Table](./guide/reference-table.md)

# Disclaimer

Can't guarantee those guides are 100% correct, and the guides aren't tested well. Also there could be a lot of broken English.

~~This happens when one person writes docs of 500 instructions + alpha~~

If there is something incorrect, please fix this.

# Special Thanks

This cannot be possible without them:

- F0NT for mapping PAC instruction name to address.
- Nemoumbra for sharing disassembled PAC instructions.
- Other modders who documented stuffs and made tools.
